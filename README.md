#### Sketch

For my Clock Design what I want to create is a visual clock inspired by Norse Mythology. Especially the Story of Skoll and Hati the two wolves that chase the sun and moon.
To create my quick sketch of my concept I used Adobe Photoshop to make the quick sketch for the concept. It is not a very detailed sketch but just a rough idea of what I want for
my clock design.

#### Maeda Clock

For starters for my maeda I followed what phoebe showed us during our lecture time to firstly learn about the maeda clocks functionality.

### Original Clock

I started off by developing my clock by firstly doing the basic clock format so I can get a good foundation as we are going on. I also changed the default background to a dark blue to fit the theme
that I am going for the project which will soon be changed to a gradient theme for a twilight, night kinda of theme to keep the Norse elements into them. For the clock functionality at the moment the clock seems to be working besides the bug that it is currently upside down. What I mean by that is that when we hit either 60 seconds, 60 minutes, 12 hours it would point at where a clock would point at
30 seconds, 30 minutes, 6 hours.
